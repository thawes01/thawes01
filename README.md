# Hello!

Hi, I’m @thawes01. I’m interested in technical, algorithmic computing and I have several years' experience as a consultant
specialising in mathematical modelling.

My main languages are Python and R, having used these for mathematical optimisation, data analysis and statistical
modelling. I have also dabbled in a bit of web development. I'm currently learning Java to expand my capabilities
in object oriented programming.
